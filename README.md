# Audio Signal Processing

My demo lectures and assignments for the course "Audio Signal Processing" offered by Universitat Pompeu Fabra trough Coursera ([online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing)).

## Week 1

On week #1 we received a quick review on the basic mathematical concepts of audio signal processing. We cover the following topics:

- Sinusoidal signals
- Complex numbers
- Fourier transform
- Euler's formula
- Scalar product of two vectors (sequences)
- Even and odd functions
- Convolution

We also covered the basics of Python for audio manupilation.

### Assignment 1

In this assignment we got introduced to: 

- `utilFunttions.py` module in `sms-tools` package
    - Functions for reading and writing audio files which handles amplitude normalization
- Basic sample manipulation:
    - Array indexing and slicing
    - Down-sampling: we discovered the effects of down-sampling on the quality of the audio signal
