# Audio Signal Processing

My demo lectures and assignments for the course "Audio Signal Processing" offered by Universitat Pompeu Fabra trough Coursera ([online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing)).

## Week 1

On week #1 we received a quick review on the basic mathematical concepts of audio signal processing. We cover the following topics:

- Sinusoidal signals
- Complex numbers
- Fourier transform
- Euler's formula
- Scalar product of two vectors (sequences)
- Even and odd functions
- Convolution

We also covered the basics of Python for audio manupilation.
